    <h2>Sprint4: Learning competencies</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      I got stuck on the fizzbuzz challenge and didn't even know how to start. I was determined not to look at the answer until I had given the kata good try. I left it and decided to go over the learning material again. I took a short break, and then just explored the meaterial that I thought would be relevant and slowly figured out how to start. The feeling between was very different the second pass because I felt happy that I had persevered instead of giving in and looking at the answer (which made me feel more useless).The techniques I used were Rubber Ducky, Try soemthing, Pseudo code. Reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      pseudocode: Im okay with this. It's certainly helpful but I tend to do it in my head and not write things down. need to work on that (6/10)
    </p>
    <p>
      Trying Something: I find this super helpful as it jogs my memory isntad of being caught in indecision. I do occasionally get lost though but its still good. (7/10)
    </p>
    <p>
      Rubber Ducky: this is good to calrify what needs doing. I find I get lost witht the logical thought sometimes in terms of mapping steps, so this is really helpful for me. (7/10)
    </p>
    <p>
      Readign errors: this is good but still dont understand some errors. should be more helpful as I start getting going more though...(4/10)
    </p>
    Console.logging: this is great. I feel like this really helps sometimes. Not helpful if the code is broken though (which mine often is) (5/10)
    <p>
      Googling: is great. SOmetimes I get random results becasue im still learning the nomencalture, but expect this will improve. (8/10)
    </p>
    <p>
      Asking peers: I'm gettign better at this. Definitel helpful and people have been really freindly and supportive which has been great. I try to return the support when I can. (7/10)
    </p>
    <p>
      Asking Coach: Good too. Prefer to run a few questions during my one on ones though as I feel better about asking once I know I've tried other avenues. (5/10)
    </p>
    <p>
      Improving processes with reflection: Tbh, I often forget to do this and need to develope this habit more. (3/10)

    <h2>Sprint3: HTML, CSS and the DOM</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      If HTML is the skeletal frame of a bauilding, then CSS is the paint, curtains, and decorations on and around it.
    <p>Control flow and loops are ways of controlling a piece of code so that instead of writing it out a million times, you are able to build conditions inot the code that must be met, and of they are, then the code can repeat itself until it no longer meeets the conditions. An example would be if I am walking to my car and want to drive away, I cant run straight up to the car, throw the key in its general direction and assume I will drive away. If I did that i would run into the car and fall over and embarass myself (and get nowhere)...FIRST I unlock the door. I cant start the car until I get in the car. Second, I get in and close the car, etc etc. I'm kind of living in a loop of re-running the same thought of running through a checklist or requirements incremntally until I finally meet all requirtemd conditions and then STOP, because I have now begun driving my car.
      <br>
      <p>
        The DOM is a live and interactive way of seeing your code in action that allows you to test things before commiting them etc.It canbe accessed in any browser (though there are diferences)
        <br>
        <P>
          An Array can usually be thought of as a list of similar items or peices of information. An Object cna be a collection of different sets of data and can also hold different collections of arrays within it.
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>
          Functions are self contained peices of code which "do" something. They are lebelled and can then be called into other processes much faster by using their names, which define them and should be descriptive of their function within the code.
        </p>

    <br><h2>Sprint2-Cultural: My learning plan</h2>
    <br>
    <h5>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h5>
    <p>
     My long term goal is to work as a story writer for a game developer like CD Project Red, which made The Witcher games franchise. This would allow me to utilise my skill and background as a writer and apply it to something that I love. Many of these jobs prefer applicants who have a working knowledge of game development and coding so that they can interface with the other developers.
     As well as this long term goal, I have a shorter term goal of working in the tech field as a junior dev wherever I could begin and secure a position in a company with a steady salary as I intend to buy a home and start a family soon.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h5>
    <p>
     I would like to develope my skills of working in a team (as I believe that the industry often works in small teams) and i would also like to develope a beter way to manage myself when stressed asI tend to get wound up and lose focus sometimes under time pressures. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h5>
    <p>
     I am extremely determined  when I indentify something as a goal that is important to me. The flipside is that if something isn't important to me the i quickly lose focus and struggle to apply myself. 
     I tend to be able to get along and deal with a large variety of people and communicate effectively. A weakness is that I goof around sometimes to blow off steam, which can be counter productive.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h5>
    <p>
     I commit to always do what i say I will do so that in any group exercises I will not slow down the progress of my fellow learners (and expect the same form them). I will do this by always putting the course first in terms of time commitments and will make sure that I am rested and taking care of myself in a manner that encourages productive and fun work. I will also treat all people respectfully.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h5>
    <p>
     I will seek help by communicating with tutors as early as I can so that there are as few surpises as possible. If I am having trouble with a project I will try toresolve it myself first before reaching out to mke sure that I deliver the work by the deadlines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h5>
    <p>
     I expect the team to mirror the way I treat them. I expect them to be reasonbaly accesible if I have an issue with any concepts and to be able to adress my questions with answers or direct me to modes of self-learning.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h5>
    <p>
     Yes. I wil be in Nelson on the weekend of the 19th and 20th of October. I am flying there on friday and will regrettably only be able to attend the first part of the Friday.
     I also will be away on Thurs 31st OCT and Friday 1st NOV In Melbourne for a medical consultation. I will be able to use my laptop to work, but obviously wont be able to attend the bootcamp on that Thursday and Friday. I return Friday evening so can hopefully catch up over that weekend.
     Other than those dates, I have no other commitments and intend to be fully engaged with my classmates and the bootcamp.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>A reflection on how I work</h5>
    <p>
    I have been using pomodoro and find it useful to do sometimes, However, I may sometimes ingnore the times and work for 2-3 hours non-stop as I fiind that sometimes the timer interrupts the natural flow of my focus and I find it counter-intuitive to stop when I am engaging with the material. I hope to be able to balance these two apporaches as I go.

    <H2>Sprint1-Cultural:Identity, values and strength exploration</H2>
    <br>
    <h5>My values and identity</h5>
    <p>
     My general creed is "Don't be an ########"
     A family member in my life is an alcoholic. They have been for many years and, although they mean well, they constatntly created problems and demanded attention. After a very long time trying to help this person, I had to make a decision to stop helping them and back away from the relationship with that family member. The consequences have been that they are more isolated as I limit contact with them. This is painful, but I have accepted it a fact that cannot be helped. Part of the consequence is also that i have more energy and focus for my wife and building ourlife and working towards out goals.
     Culturally, I have a rather WASP'y background. That means lots of fake smiles and polite conversation with sub-text beneath it. I dislike it and tend to stay away from that "type" of person as I find them diffucult to relate to. As such I can occasionally be extremely frank and honest, which gets me in trouble sometimes.
     A positive thing about my culture is my cutural identity as being part scandinavian. I have a great interest in their mythology and poetry, which is often black-humoured and ascerbic. I try to laugh at the bad things in life.
    </p>
    <h5>My strenghts</h5>
    <p>
     Having been self-employed since 2014 I have a reserve of dsicipline for doing things un-managed. This has also made me rather shy around people as a great deal of time has been spent alone working. My Myers-Briggs category is Mediator; <em>Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine.</em>My stengths are that I am able to get along with most people and am very driven, but the drawbakc is that I ccan easlit overlook details sometimes because I may be off with the fairies a bit. I am fairly emotionally inteligent and I think that this skill will be one of my stronger advantages to building a career.
     I write with my wife on certain projects and we can work very fast, but after a lot of experience, we have definitly found that it is best if we work on a project one at a time. When we are both writing at the same time, we fight and begin to annoy eachother becasue critiscism is taken personally in those circumstances. How we fixed it was that we now only look at soemthing after the other pserson has finished their work on it. We then discuss it and are able to work more productivly by not sittign on eachothers' heads while we work.
