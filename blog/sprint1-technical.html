      When writing the markup code for websites, classes and id's are extremely useful to identify things thta you want to syle using CSS.
      The problem is that, it kinda feels like they do the same thing... And they do. 
      But, although theis doesnt seem to matter now, later versions of browsers may not recognize classes and id's as they do now, if we dont adhere to the best practice rules for them.
      For example: Javascript has a function called <em>getElementById</em> that allows you to madofy elements based on their id. It does now, however have the capaility for classes. This means that by not adhering to the best preactice, you might end up having to rebuild pages down the line.
