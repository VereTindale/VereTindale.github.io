<div class="hello">
    <p>My name is Vere. It's like Beer, but with a "V". I grew up In South Africa to a Zimbabwean mum and kiwi Dad. I have worked as a writer and actor full-time for the last half decade and have really enjoyed it but would like to also start a career in software developement for a bit more stability and because the field looks extremely interesting. I love Horror films and all sorts of books<em> (Charles Bukowski and Stephen King are a few of my favourites),</em> and am a terrible surfer. </p>
