      <p>
      When writing the markup code for websites, classes and id's are extremely useful to identify things thta you want to syle using CSS.
      The problem is that, it kinda feels like they do the same thing... And they do. 
      But, although theis doesnt seem to matter now, later versions of browsers may not recognize classes and id's as they do now, if we dont adhere to the best practice rules for them.
      For example: Javascript has a function called <em>getElementById</em> that allows you to madofy elements based on their id. It does now, however have the capaility for classes. This means that by not adhering to the best preactice, you might end up having to rebuild pages down the line.

      <h4>What is best practice then?</h4>
      <p>Basically, think of the id tag as a way to identify single elements by themselves. The class tag on the other hand, identifies groups of things that you would want to change together. A good example of this is a news site; The layout tends to stay the same, but the content inside it changes almost constantly. By nesting classes within id's, we can apply things to them without effecting the boxes they are conatined in.

      <h2>My learning plan</h2>
      <br>
      <h5>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h5>
      <p>
       My long term goal is to work as a story writer for a game developer like CD Project Red, which made The Witcher games franchise. This would allow me to utilise my skill and background as a writer and apply it to something that I love. Many of these jobs prefer applicants who have a working knowledge of game development and coding so that they can interface with the other developers.
       As well as this long term goal, I have a shorter term goal of working in the tech field as a junior dev wherever I could begin and secure a position in a company with a steady salary as I intend to buy a home and start a family soon.  
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h5>
      <p>
       I would like to develope my skills of working in a team (as I believe that the industry often works in small teams) and i would also like to develope a beter way to manage myself when stressed asI tend to get wound up and lose focus sometimes under time pressures. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h5>
      <p>
       I am extremely determined  when I indentify something as a goal that is important to me. The flipside is that if something isn't important to me the i quickly lose focus and struggle to apply myself. 
       I tend to be able to get along and deal with a large variety of people and communicate effectively. A weakness is that I goof around sometimes to blow off steam, which can be counter productive.  
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h5>
      <p>
       I commit to always do what i say I will do so that in any group exercises I will not slow down the progress of my fellow learners (and expect the same form them). I will do this by always putting the course first in terms of time commitments and will make sure that I am rested and taking care of myself in a manner that encourages productive and fun work. I will also treat all people respectfully.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h5>
      <p>
       I will seek help by communicating with tutors as early as I can so that there are as few surpises as possible. If I am having trouble with a project I will try toresolve it myself first before reaching out to mke sure that I deliver the work by the deadlines.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h5>
      <p>
       I expect the team to mirror the way I treat them. I expect them to be reasonbaly accesible if I have an issue with any concepts and to be able to adress my questions with answers or direct me to modes of self-learning.  
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h5>
      <p>
       Yes. I wil be in Nelson on the weekend of the 19th and 20th of october. I am flying there on friday and will regrettably only be able to attend the first part of the Friday.
       I also will be away on Thurs 31st and Friday 1st In Melbourne for a medical consultation. I will be able to use my laptop to work, but obviously wont be able to attend the bootcamp on that Thursday and Friday. I return Friday evening so can hopefully catch up over that weekend.
       Other than those dates, I have no other commitments and intend to be fully engaged with my classmates and the bootcamp.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>A reflection on how I work</h5>
      <p>
      I have been using pomodoro and find it useful to do sometimes, However, I may sometimes ingnore the times and work for 2-3 hours non-stop as I fiind that sometimes the timer interrupts the natural flow of my focus and I find it counter-intuitive to stop when I am engaging with the material. I hope to be able to balance these two apporaches as I go.
