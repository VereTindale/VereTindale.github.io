    <p>
        EQ is basically the ability measure of a person's ability to empathize as well as utilize and interpersonal and intrapersonal communication in their interactions with others and themselves. In a society with fewer and fewer human interactions going on than ever before, it is has become an important measure of intelligence that can and should be developed. EQ (like all the other measures of intellegence) can be developed adn this can lead to being a better communicator and present ideas in a way that is better digested by those around you.
